# Learn-How-to-Work-with-Numbers-and-Strings-by-Implementing-the-Luhn-Algorithm
The Luhn Algorithm serves as a fundamental error-checking method, widely applied in various contexts like credit card number verification. Through this project, I've acquired hands-on experience in numerical computations and string manipulation, essential skills in programming and data validation. Dive into this project to strengthen your understanding of these core concepts and their practical applications.
